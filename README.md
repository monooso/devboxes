# Devboxes
Experiments in using Docker as an IDE.

## Boxes

- `devbox-base`: The base upon which all of the other boxes are built. Installs all of the development tools I need, regardless of tech-stack.
- `devbox-elixir`: Used for Elixir projects. Installs Erlang and Elixir, and any related tooling.
